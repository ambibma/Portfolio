    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p> My name is Ambi Hidalgo. I am a 28 year old woman from Los Angeles. For most of my adult life I have focused on balancing work and my creative work. Skateboarding, painting, and airbrushing all things I like to focus on. This year, my focus has changed to programming education at Epicodus. I have never done any coding prior to attending, but at this moment, it has allowed me to set up new goals for myself upon attending.
      <div class="goals">
        <ol>
          <li>Collaborate,be kind, and understand the material throughly.</li>
          <li>Graduate!</li>
          <li>Intern and work on something that excites me</li>
          <li><strong>Get a Job!</strong></li>
        </ol>
